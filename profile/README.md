# What the Flash

This organisation is the GitHub repo for one of my YouTube resources, however, creating stuff for YouTube has been parked because that's not what I wanted to do long-term, it started as a side hobby that quickly became time consuming and a distraction for what I actually want to do. Therefore the projects in this organisation will be move to other more relatable organisations.

This GitHub organisation can become a training space or even the seedling for a digital agency. More to follow some time soon.
